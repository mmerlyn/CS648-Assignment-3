# CS648-Assignment-3

_This README serves as a summary and guide for Module 03 on CSS, providing context, key learnings, and usage instructions for practical implementation._

## Overview

This assignment covers the fundamentals of CSS, including selectors, properties, and styling techniques. The goal is to understand how CSS works, how to apply different types of selectors, and how to use various properties to style HTML elements effectively.

## Topics Covered

- **Introduction to CSS**
  - What is CSS
  - Why use CSS
  - How CSS works
  - Defining styles
- **Selector Types**
  - CSS1, CSS2, CSS3 selectors
  - Examples of each selector type
- **Exploring CSS Properties**
  - Font properties
  - Background properties
  - Block, box, and border properties
  - List and positioning properties

## Key Learnings

- Difference between class (`.`) and id (`#`) selectors
- Understanding type selectors and descendant selectors
- The three methods of applying CSS: external, embedded, inline
- Use of shorthand properties (e.g., `background`, `border`)
- Proper application of font, text, and layout-related CSS properties
- Improved understanding of positioning (`relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`)

## Usage

1. Link your CSS file to an HTML document using the `<link>` tag for external styles.
2. Apply class or id selectors to HTML elements as needed.
3. Use CSS properties to define styling rules according to your design requirements.
4. Test the layout and style in a browser to ensure it works as expected.

## Reflection

Through this module, I strengthened my understanding of CSS selectors, shorthand properties, and positioning techniques. I now have better clarity on writing maintainable CSS and targeting elements efficiently without overcomplicating the HTML structure.
